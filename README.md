# Useful tips for Python

Some useful tips and concepts I learnt throught the time. This repo is organized
in folders. In each folder there are numbered Jupyter Notebooks. The numbers
are just an optional/personal order.

The code snippets and examples are from many sources: books, courses,
StackOverflow...

- [code_snippets folder](code_snippets): code snippets that are useful to
understand some topics

- [study_notes folder](study_notes): some personal study notes
